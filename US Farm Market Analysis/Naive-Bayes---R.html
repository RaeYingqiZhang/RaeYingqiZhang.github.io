          <br>Naive Bayes is a Supervised Machine Learning algorithm based on the Bayes Theorem that is used to solve classification problems by following a probabilistic approach.

Meaning that the outcome of a model depends on a set of independent variables that have nothing to do with each other.

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Overview of Naive Bayes</span>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;"></span>A topic for further exploration is whether (and how) the naive Bayes classifier’s assumption of feature independence hurts its performance relative to other algorithms. But the independence assumption is also one of its key advantages as it allows for quick training and predictions even on very large datasets. Also, <span style="font-weight: 700;">naive Bayes has almost no hyperparameters to tune</span>, so it usually generalizes well. One thing to note is that due to the feature independence assumption, the class probabilities output by naive Bayes can be pretty inaccurate. So if your end application requires precise estimates of probabilities, you will want to go with another algorithm.<br>
          <br>On the other hand, despite its naiveté, naive Bayes often does a reasonably good job of picking the right class — it may not be that good at estimating absolute probabilities, but it is pretty good at measuring relative likelihoods.

        <p class="u-text u-text-custom-color-3 u-text-2">The naiveBayes() function takes the crop train data, and its label list to build a naive Bayes model and predict the label of the test crop data.  Laplace smoothing is&nbsp;<b>a smoothing technique that helps tackle the problem of zero probability in the Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithm</b>.(<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/laplace-smoothing-in-na%C3%AFve-bayes-algorithm-9c237a8bdece#:~:text=Laplace%20smoothing%20is%20a%20smoothing%20technique%20that%20helps%20tackle%20the,the%20positive%20and%20negative%20reviews." class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1" target="_blank">towards datas cience</a>).

          <br>Using naive Bayes is a very good idea when we have a<b> large volumns of data</b>. Even though it has almost no parameter to tune the accuracy of the prediction, naive Bayes is good at choosing the correct label for the data. It doesn't do well in predicting the exact proabilities, but it can give us a decent estimation on relative likelihood measures. Plues, it gives very good results when it comes to NLP tasks such as sentimental analysis.<br>
          <br>The variable importance performance helps me build a generl idea on how different encironment conditions affect the growth of the crops. The most sensitive factor to crops is the ph value in the soil, and the second sesitive factor is rainfall. My conslusion of the graph is when we want to improve the performance of a crop, the very first two factors we need to consider are the ph value and rainfall volumn around the crop.
