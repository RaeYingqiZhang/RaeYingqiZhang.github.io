        </h2>
        <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-custom-color-2 u-text-2"> Food is always a&nbsp;topic in life. Growing crops starts from sowing to harvesting. Raising livestock begins from breeding to selling. Farms are where all those things are happening. From local farms, farmers market activities, to commercial farms with million-dollar businesses, all of them are acting an essential role in our lives and well-being.<br>&nbsp;<br>With respect and curiosity, my portfolio would explore the overall strength and weakness of U.S. -based farms according to their operation age, size, type, financial statements, demographics, etc. This project is to discover the evolvements of American farms given the past 10 years, and to predict their future capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Speaking of farm products, we have to mention a more and more popular section - organic food, as consumers are more willing to spend their money on health and quality of life. Therefore, this project is also going to take an in-depth assessment of how the organic food market is affecting the performance of traditional farms.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>After viewing my portfolio, the audience would gain better knowledge on farms’ shortage and strength by states and regions, a clearer idea of their evolvements over time, and the ability to predict farms performance in future given the influence of organic market and political-economic issues.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>My portfolio contains the data gathered from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), its subdivision <a dataquery="YWRpX2xpbmtfZDRmYWQ5OTY=" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Economic Research Service</a>(ERS), <a dataquery="YWRpX2xpbmtfNThlZTI3MzI=" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">Agricultural Marketing Service</a> (AMS), and <a dataquery="YWRpX2xpbmtfMzgwZjg4NzM=" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-3">PubAg</a>, the news articles data from NewsAPI.com, and the text data from Twitter.com.
