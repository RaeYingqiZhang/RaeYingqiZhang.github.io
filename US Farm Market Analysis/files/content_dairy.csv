It has been well-documented that restrictions on nutrient losses from dairy farms are likely to negatively impact on farm profitability. Less understood is the influence of these regulations on rural land values. Dairy land values have traditionally been driven, in part, by changes in profitability expectations, although lags exist. Therefore, there is a risk that the costs of implementing water quality limits will impact on rural land values. Farm systems modelling was used to investigate the cost of reducing nutrient losses. Present valuation methodology was then used to examine the potential impact of this cost on dairy farm land values. Results show that mitigating nutrient losses from dairy farms in Southland reduces operating profit, resulting in a reduction of land value. Modelling suggests a 20% reduction in nitrogen leaching reduced operating profit by 14% and land value by 17%. The 25th and 75th percentile for the reduction in operating profit was −17.2% and −10.5% respectively.

The knowledge of the genetic diversity and epidemiology of AstVs in Africa is limited. This study aimed to characterize astroviruses in asymptomatic smallholder piglets in Kenya and Uganda. Twenty-four samples were randomly selected from a total of 446 piglets aged below 6 months that were initially collected for rotavirus study and sequenced for whole genome analysis. Thirteen (13/24) samples had contigs with high identity to genus Mamastrovirus. Analysis of seven strains with complete (or near complete) AstV genome revealed variable nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities with known porcine astrovirus (PoAstV) strains. The U083 and K321 strains had nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 66.4 to 75.4% with the known PoAstV2 strains; U460 strain had nucleotide sequence identities of 57.0 to 65.1% regarding the known PoAstV3; and K062, K366, K451, and K456 strains had nucleotide sequence identities of 63.5 to 80% with the known PoAstV4 strains. The low sequence identities (<90%) indicate that novel genotypes of PoAstVs are circulating in the study area. Recombination analysis using whole genomes revealed evidence of multiple recombination events in PoAstV4, suggesting that recombination might have contributed to the observed genetic diversity. Linear antigen epitope prediction and a comparative analysis of capsid protein of our field strains identified potential candidate epitopes that could help in the design of immuno-diagnostic tools and a subunit vaccine.

Adoption rates were estimated from sales data of T. koningii pure culture, and net incremental changes based on reviewed field experiments in the Cordillera region, Philippines and partial budget analysis based on farmer interviews. Findings showed that T. koningii are being used mostly by organic and good agricultural practice producers as biofungicide for disease management, and as soil nutrient and compost enhancer. T. koningii pure culture annual geometric growth rate of sales was at 29.7% and overall adoption rate in Benguet in 2018 was roughly estimated at 0.03%. Identified constraints to adoption are: high price; misconception that Trichoderma is for organic farmers only; slow effect of the technology; limited information; and limited market outlets and marketing strategies. The estimated change in yield due to use of T. koningii ranged from 10% to 50% based on farmer interviews, and 4%–92% based on field and pot experiments in various crops and uses from literature. The net present value (NPV) assuming a 10% real social discount rate is PhP4.3 M (USD0.08M), and the rate of returns for the Philippine government investing resources in T. koningii development and promotion was estimated at 49.1% considering a 10-year period. Assuming the lowest estimate of net benefit at PhP28670 ha⁻¹ (547 USD ha⁻¹) and 20 years project duration, the NPV is Php3.7 M (USD 0.07M).

This is because resistance management provides long‐term rather than short‐term benefits that operators may be less assured of capturing on land they do not own. Yet, empirical evidence supporting this argument has been lacking. RESULTS: This study reports on results from a large‐scale national survey of weed management and other crop production practices on US agricultural fields. Up to 11 weed management practices were compared across owner‐operated versus renter‐operated fields. Analysis of survey data from corn and soybean fields did not support the hypothesis that adoption of resistance management practices is lower on rented acres. In most instances, there were no statistically significant differences in herbicide use or weed management practices on rented versus owned land. This was true at both national and regional levels of analysis. Where there were significant differences, practices associated with greater herbicide resistance management were, as often as not, more prevalent on rented than owned land. CONCLUSIONS: A useful area of future research would be to test for land tenure differences in resistance management using multivariate analysis to control for confounding effects. Unobserved farmer or land characteristics may be confounding results and masking land tenure effects. Results here, however, suggest that these other effects are dominating any obvious disincentive effects of land leasing on resistance management. Of greater concern, the adoption of key resistance management practices was low on both owned and rented land. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","2020-06","2020","7980-2020","1526-498X","article","no. 6","v. 76","2030","2039","9","pp. 2030-2039","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.5737","10.1002/ps.5737","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

This has important ramifications for injury and economic burden. The objective of this research was to conduct a pilot study to investigate whether small- to medium-area farms implement fewer safety practices than large-area farms. Methods: Farmers were recruited from farm safety training days, field days, and produce stores in rural New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Small- and medium-area farms less than 500 ha (1235 acres) in size were aggregated for analysis and compared with large-area farms (≥500 ha) for survey items, including safety equipment owned and used, safety practices protecting children, barriers to improving safety, and causes of injury. Results: Overall, small/medium-area farms were found to own less safety equipment and to employ less safety practices than large-area farms. In particular, fewer tractors were fitted with rollover protection structures, there was less signage, less hearing protection, and fewer machinery guides. Injury rates were slightly less for small/medium-area farms, particularly involving vehicles. Small- and medium-area farmers were more likely to report lack of skills as barriers to making safety improvements. Conclusion: This pilot study found some evidence that small/medium-area farms implement fewer safety practices than large-area farms. A larger study is warranted to investigate this further, with particular focus on barriers and ways to overcome them. This could have important ramifications for government policies supporting struggling farmers on small/medium-area farms.","2017-07-03","2017","7983-2017","1545-0813","article","no. 3","v. 22","229","234","5","pp. 229-234","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2017.1318101","10.1080/1059924X.2017.1318101","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

In many irrigation systems, energy costs are now threatening their sustainability. However, new opportunities have arisen for the use of renewable energies in the irrigation sector. These are some of the aspects of the multifaceted multiple‐actor ‘water–food–energy' nexus. Technical, economic and environmental issues are linked in many ways, involving farmers, water users' associations, energy suppliers, engineers and other stakeholders. The ICID session ‘Irrigation and energy' triggered discussions on these multiple dimensions. This paper presents a synthesis of the presentations, discussions and conclusions. Four main questions are addressed: How do irrigation productivity and sustainability of water resources exploitation change when farmers have access to energy? What do we know about energy efficiency in irrigation systems, at farm and collective network levels? How can this efficiency be optimized by using advanced technologies, modelling tools, improved management? Is energy production an opportunity for irrigation systems? These questions have been posed based on multiple case studies from different parts of the world. The BRL network, in southern France, illustrates advanced strategies and opportunities to reduce energy consumption and develop energy production at a network level.

Sustainable agriculture aims to balance the economic, environmental, and social aspects of farming, creating a resilient farming system in the long-term. Over the last few decades, various concepts have been used in research and policy to encourage the adoption of sustainable practices. Within such a congested space, this paper assesses the value of ‘integrated farm management’ as a concept for the promotion of sustainable agriculture. The concept is the subject of renewed policy interest in England and Wales and it is also being promoted in Europe. Previous research, however, has suggested that integrated farm management may not be well understood or widely practised. There are also criticisms that it can be impractical and poorly differentiated from similar ideas. As such, renewed insights are required into how useful the concept might be for encouraging sustainable agriculture. Using a mixed methods approach, we gathered the views of farmers, farm advisors, and industry representatives about integrated farm management in England and Wales, and interpreted these through a theoretical framework to judge the strength of the concept. Overall, the general principles of Integrated Farm Management were found to be coherent and familiar to most of our respondents. However, the concept performed poorly in terms of its resonance, simplicity of message, differentiation from other similar terms and theoretical utility. We reflect on our findings in the context of other ways to promote sustainable agriculture, drawing out messages for policy and knowledge exchange in England and Wales, as well as elsewhere.","2019-02","2019","7981-2019","0264-8377","article",NA,"v. 81","834","842","8","pp. 834-842","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.11.001","10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.11.001","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

To improve the state of agriculture, various management changes have been proposed. Different tools, with varying characteristics, sustainability framing and indicators, have been used to evaluate the impact of these changes on sustainability. Here, we review 119 tools for farm sustainability assessment and compare their use, sustainability dimensions, themes and types of indicators used for biodiversity conservation, farm viability and gender equity. Our main findings are that (1) tools could be classified into five groups that differ in stakeholder participation and model used for calculating sustainability, (2) seven different sustainability framings are used and (3) only two out of 29 indicators screened address impacts of farming system while the others address drivers, pressures or states of the system. The tools were grouped in “Long-term monitoring of farm activities” (11%), “Ex-ante assessment of sustainability with bioeconomic models” (9%), “Survey- and indicator-based assessment of tools” (41%), “Consultation-based assessment” (25%) and “Active engagement of stakeholder-based assessment” (14%). The “classical view of sustainability”, with the economic, social and environmental pillars, was used in 61% of the papers. Based on these findings, we suggest (1) development of temporal dynamic assessment of farm sustainability with active involvement of stakeholders in the framing of sustainability and design of indicators to achieve reliable and relevant assessment outcomes. We recommend (2) adoption of more complex sustainability framings dealing with emerging system properties, namely resilience, viability and stability. In these, (3) governance/institutional dimensions should be emphasised, and social themes targeting farmers’ characteristics should be included. Finally, (4) use of impact indicators in farm sustainability assessments is critical, and they should be designed to contribute to scientifically rigorous and relevant assessments of farming system sustainability.","2021-04","2021","7979-2021","1774-0746","article","no. 2","v. 41","19","19","1","pp. 19-19","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-021-00674-3","10.1007/s13593-021-00674-3","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Conventionally hatched chickens can remain without access to feed and water up to 72 h after hatching until placement on the farm. The current study compared day-old chicken quality, performance, and slaughter yield of broiler chickens that were on-farm hatched (OH), hatchery-fed (HF), or conventionally hatchery-hatched (HH).

The experiment was repeated during 3 consecutive production cycles. Chickens originated from young parent stock flocks. Results showed that HF and OH chickens were heavier and longer than HH chickens at day (D) 1. Relative weight of stomach and intestines were highest for OH chickens. The OH chickens had worse day-old chicken quality in terms of navel condition and red hocks than HH and HF chickens. Treatments did not differ in first wk and total mortality. From D0 until slaughter age, body weight was highest for OH, followed by HF and HH. Furthermore, carcass weight at slaughter age (D40) was highest for OH chickens, followed by HF and HH chickens.

Such demographic trends may reduce agricultural productivity and increase food insecurity, both among farmers and in the region. Using data collected through interviews with 368 farmers in the Prachin Buri province of Thailand, this research aims to examine how ageing is affecting farm activities of older farmers (60 years and older) and how they are adapting. We found that, while a small percentage of older farmers intended to continue farming without making any changes over the next five years (~9%), most were concerned about their health and farm work capacity, and were looking to leave farming and implement strategies to reduce both work intensity and time. Most farmers intended to stop farming and transfer farmland to their children (~40%), or continue farming while making some changes (~30%), such as employing additional workers or switching to less labour intense crops. Some intended to stop farming altogether and dispose of farmland outside their family (~21%; e.g. leasing out or selling or returning farmland to owner if leased). As expected, the chosen strategy depended on personal (old-age income security and gender) and farm characteristics (e.g. successor, farm activities, and subsidy). Having a dedicated successor had a substantial impact on transferring land to the children, reflecting the importance of commitment for farming by the next generation, which will be challenging. A pension higher than the widely available old-age allowance could support farmers in maintaining a better living standard after retiring. However, only a fraction of farmers currently had access to a pension. Both short- and long-term policies are, therefore, needed to support elderly farmers, improve their living standards after retirement, and attract young people back to farming.","2021-01","2021","7979-2021","0743-0167","article",NA,"v. 81","37","46","9","pp. 37-46","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.12.003","10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.12.003","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Utilizing the Fitch scheme, specific for wind farms, a period of one year is simulated with a daily operational forecasting set-up. Power and wind predictions are obtained and compared with real data at each wind turbine hub, provided by the management company. Results show that WRF yields good wind power operational predictions for this kind of wind farms, due to a good representation of the planetary boundary layer behaviour of the region and the good performance of the Fitch scheme under these conditions.

Six flocks (F1–6) on a commercial farm were allocated to three treatment groups. Flocks F1 and F4 were treated (TT) with fenbendazole at 22, 27 and 36 weeks post-placement (WPP). Flocks F2 and F5 were treated at 27 WPP (conventional treatment, CT) and hens in flocks F3 and F6 served as untreated (UT) control groups. At 19, 35 and 45 WPP twenty-five hens plus thirty eggs per flock were randomly selected. Hens were weighed and their plumage conditions (PC) were assessed. The eggs were subjected to various external and interior quality analyses. Production data such as number of eggs/hen/week, egg mass and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated from raw data obtained from all flocks on a weekly basis. The number of eggs/hen/week, egg mass and FCR were higher (P < 0.05) in the TT flocks and hens had better PC both at 35 and 45 WPP compared with other flocks. No differences in body weight and physical egg quality were observed between groups except for egg shell strength which was higher (P < 0.05) in the CT flocks. These data suggest that better production performance and plumage, which suggests improved health, can be achieved through the application of a TT strategy. The insights gained from this research should help to justify the extra cost and labor associated with the TT strategy.","2020-10","2020","7980-2020","0304-4017","article",NA,"v. 286","109238",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.109238","10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.109238","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Such systems can provide both data and alerts to several productive, behavioral, and physiological indicators on individual cows. Currently, there is still a lack of knowledge on both the proportion of dairy farms that invested in SS and type of SS installed. Additionally, it is still unclear whether the performances of herds equipped with SS differ from those of similar herds managed without any technological aid. Therefore, the aims of this study were (1) to provide an insight into SS spread among Italian dairy farms and (2) to analyze the performances of similar herds equipped or not equipped with SS. To reach the former goal, a large survey was carried out on 964 dairy farms in the northeast of Italy. Farmers were interviewed by the technicians of the regional breeders association to collect information on the type of SS installed on farms and the main parameters recorded. Overall, 42% of the surveyed farms had at least 1 SS, and most of them (72%) reared more than 50 cows. Sensors for measuring individual cow milk yield were the most prevalent type installed (39% of the surveyed farms), whereas only 15% of farms had SS for estrus detection. More sophisticated parameters, such as rumination, were automatically monitored in less than 5% of the farms. To reach the latter goal of the study, a subset of 100 Holstein dairy farms with similar characteristics was selected: half of them were equipped with SS for monitoring at least individual milk yield and estrus, and the other half were managed without any SS. Average herd productive and reproductive data from official test days over 3 yr were analyzed. The outcomes of the comparison showed that farms with SS had higher mature-equivalent milk production. Further clustering analysis of the same 100 farms partitioned them into 3 clusters based on herd productive and reproductive data. Results of the Chi-squared test showed that the proportion of farms equipped with SS was greater in the cluster with the best performance (e.g., higher milk yield and shorter calving interval). However, the presence of a few farms equipped with SS in the least productive cluster for the same parameters pointed out that although the installation of SS may support farmers in time- and labor-saving or in data recording, it is not a guarantee of better herd performance.","2020-11","2020","7980-2020","0022-0302","article","no. 11","v. 103","10264","10272","8","pp. 10264-10272","https://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17973","10.3168/jds.2019-17973","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Despite improvements in virus characterization, it is unclear whether PRRSV infections are a product of viral circulation within production systems (local) or across production systems (external). Here, we examined the local and external dissemination dynamics of PRRSV and the processes facilitating its spread in three production systems. Overall, PRRSV genetic diversity has declined since 2018, while phylodynamic results support frequent external transmission. We found that PRRSV dissemination predominantly occurred mostly through transmission between farms of different production companies for several months, especially from November until May, a timeframe already established as PRRSV season. Although local PRRSV dissemination occurred mainly through regular pig flow (from sow to nursery and then to finisher farms), an important flux of PRRSV dissemination also occurred in the opposite direction, from finisher to sow and nursery farms, highlighting the importance of downstream farms as sources of the virus. Our results also showed that farms with pig densities of 500 to 1,000 pig/km² and farms located at a range within 0.5 km and 0.7 km from major roads were more likely to be infected by PRRSV, whereas farms at an elevation of 41 to 61 meters and surrounded by denser vegetation were less likely to be infected, indicating their role as dissemination barriers. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that external dissemination was intense, and reinforce the importance of farm proximity on PRRSV spread. Thus, consideration of farm location, geographic characteristics and animal densities across production systems may help to forecast PRRSV collateral dissemination.","2021-03","2021","7979-2021","1865-1674","article","no. 2","v. 68","667","683","16","pp. 667-683","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13728","10.1111/tbed.13728","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Data from an existing labor efficiency study on Irish dairy farms were used in conjunction with economic performance data from the farms. Tasks that required the highest level of farm labor per day in the spring were identified and hypothetical strategies to reduce the farm hours worked per day were examined. A stochastic budgetary simulation model was then used to examine the economic implications of employing these strategies and the effects of their use in conjunction with a proportionate increase in cow numbers that would leave the hours worked per day unchanged. The strategies were to use contractors to perform calf rearing, machinery work, or milking. Contracting out milking resulted in the greatest reduction in hours worked per day (5.6 h/d) followed by calf rearing (2.7 h/d) and machinery work (2 h/d). Reducing the hours worked per day by removing those tasks had slight (i.e., <5%) negative effects on profitability; however, maintaining the farm hours worked per day while utilizing the same strategies and increasing herd sizes resulted in profitable options. The most profitable scenario was for farms to increase herd size while contracting out milking.","2019-09","2019","7981-2019","0022-0302","article","no. 9","v. 102","8431","8440","9","pp. 8431-8440","https://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-15299","10.3168/jds.2018-15299","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

We find large, but heterogeneous, price changes for different vegetables with relatively larger changes seen at the farm level, compared to the consumer level, leading to winners and losers among local vegetable farmers due to pandemic‐related trade disruptions. We further note that despite substantial hurdles in domestic trade reported by most value chain agents, increases in marketing—and especially transportation—costs have not been the major contributor to overall changes in retail prices. Marketing margins even declined for half of the vegetables studied.

We perform the LESs of neutrally-stratified atmospheric boundary layer over the eight large wind farms with the turbines arranged with a perfectly-aligned configuration, four laterally-staggered configurations, and three vertically-staggered configurations. Unlike the alignment of the turbine micro-siting in the aligned wind farm, both the laterally-staggered and vertically-staggered configurations lead to the misalignment of the turbines with staggered arrangement in the lateral and vertical directions.

In general, the staggered wind farms produce more power than the aligned wind farm.

The objective of this study was to assess the extent of that risk and to evaluate the effect of intervention measures along the agri-food chain. A stochastic farm-to-fork quantitative microbial risk assessment model was developed following the Codex Alimentarius Guidelines for Risk Analysis of Foodborne Antimicrobial Resistance. Different scenarios were analyzed to assess the individual relative effects of 18 possible interventions in comparison to a baseline scenario. The baseline scenario represented the first year of on-farm antimicrobial use surveillance in the Canadian broiler industry and the year before an industry-imposed ban on the preventive use of antimicrobials of very high importance to human health (2013), where 31.3% of broiler flocks consisted of birds to which ceftiofur was administered.The baseline scenario predicted an average probability of illness of 1.1 per 100,000 servings (SE: 0.064 per 100,000), corresponding to an average of 22,000 human infections (SE: 1900) with ceftiofur-resistant S. Heidelberg per year, which is likely an overestimation. This risk was reduced by 90% or 20% when two separate scenarios designed to capture the effect of withdrawing preventive ceftiofur use from poultry production were simulated using different approaches; data used for the former scenario were confounded by other potential concomitant control measures (e.g. Salmonella vaccination programme), so the true effect likely lies somewhere between the two estimates. A theoretical ‘worst case’ scenario where all flocks had birds exposed to ceftiofur increased the risk by 107%. A 50% reduction in the probability of human prior exposure to antimicrobials, which has a selective and competitive effect for Salmonella spp. following ingestion of contaminated products, reduced the risk by 65%. Other promising measures that could be considered for further risk management included improved cleaning and disinfection between broiler flocks on farm (risk reduction by 26%), exclusive use of air chilling (risk reduction by 34%), and the improvement of meat storage and preparation conditions, e.g., no temperature abuse at retail (risk reduction by 88%). These findings showed the importance of a structured approach to assessing and potentially implementing effective interventions to reduce the risk associated with ceftiofur-resistant S. Heidelberg at different steps along the agri-food chain.Major data gaps included information on concentrations of resistant bacteria, cross contamination at processing and how ceftiofur-resistant S.

The decline in production adversely impacts the livelihood of local rubber smallholder farmers. To understand why this decline in rubber production has occurred, we used a systems thinking approach to analyze the underlying feedback mechanisms controlling rubber production. In addition to secondary data, we conducted focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with various actors and experts in the rubber supply chain across Peninsular Malaysia in order to develop a dynamic hypothesis that explains the decline in rubber production over time. Our analysis shows that feedback loops between global demand and supply, national rubber price, and smallholder farmer income determines rubber production at the local scale. In general, the lack of compliance and participation in the global exports restriction policy, insufficient national price incentives, and the absence of national import regulations have kept rubber prices low, leading to low profitability for smallholder farmers. This has caused smallholder farmers to reduce tapping activities and farm maintenance. Some have left rubber farming altogether. This has reduced rubber plantation area and rubber production. We propose several policy improvements to address the issue: (1) enhance the monitoring of rubber supply in the global market through international collaboration; (2) increase domestic rubber consumption through government projects and incentives and eventually follow this up with strict rubber import regulations; and (3) increase smallholder farmer income through the enhancement of government incentives and R&D, formation of co-operatives, application of crop diversification, and obtaining support from the private sector. The findings of this study are also applicable to other rubber-producing countries due to the similar dynamics that exist in the rubber production system globally. The approach adopted in this study can better facilitate engagement with rubber stakeholders, especially smallholder farmers, and inform the formulation of effective smallholder-oriented policies.","2021-06","2021","7979-2021","1389-9341","article",NA,"v. 127","102449",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2021.102449","10.1016/j.forpol.2021.102449","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

The main objective of this study was to quantify the effect of different extended lactation strategies on herd productivity, farm economics and sustainability at product level with focus on greenhouse gas emission. The herd model SimHerd simulated cow state, production, replacement and herd dynamics that supported a quantification of the effect of managing either first lactation, older or all cows for calving intervals of either 15 or 17 months compared with 13 months. The initial herd was self-sufficient with replacement heifers, and the extended lactations were achieved by only changing time of first possible insemination while keeping insemination and conception rates as well as all other production and management parameters unchanged. The different extended lactation strategies reduced annual milk production and herd feed use up to 4.1 and 7.1%, respectively, which combined caused herd milk production per kg DM herd feed use to increase with up to 3.5%. Replacement rate per annual cow (per cow per year) was reduced with up to 13.6% points and the number of youngstock per annual cow with 27%. Managing only first lactation cows for extended lactations resulted in close to negligible production effects compared with baseline scenario and positively affected farm contribution margin whereas the other strategies had a negative effect on farm contribution margin per cow of up to 3.2%. The reduction in herd feed use reduced farm area for feed production, and the economic effect of using this area to either feed more cows or grow a cash crop was greater than the negative economic effect of the extended lactation strategy itself. Hence, the overall economic effect depends on the ability of the farmer to realise savings and utilise a potential freed area. Finally, the extended lactation strategies reduced greenhouse gas emissions with up to 8.1% per annual cow where less feed production and less enteric fermentation were determining factors.However, the weight ratio between milk and meat increased up to 34.7% across scenarios, which affected the allocation of emissions. Hence, emissions were reduced per cow but unchanged per kg milk. If the market requires an unchanged supply of milk and beef meat, then these extended lactation strategies caused an indirect emission from production of substitute beef meat, which can lead to an increased total emission. In conclusion, managing dairy cows for extended lactations can be an economically viable production strategy if the farmer is able to realise potential savings and gains. Emissions are reduced per cow but the sector level effect for milk and beef meat can be unchanged or even increased.","2019-02","2019","7981-2019","1871-1413","article",NA,"v. 220","100","110","10","pp. 100-110","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2018.12.014","10.1016/j.livsci.2018.12.014","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

A huge number of turbine combinations (577) was processed, resulting in 22,721 generated layouts. Various assumptions and constraints were considered, mostly derived from the literature, including site features, wind conditions, and layout design. For the latter, an irregularly staggered turbine array configuration was assumed. Wake effects were simulated through the Jensen’s model, while a typical turbine thrust coefficient curve as a function of wind speed was originally developed. A detailed cost model was used, with levelized cost of energy selected as primary and capacity factor as secondary objective function. The self-organizing maps were used to address a thorough analysis, proving to be a powerful means to straightforwardly achieve a comprehensive pattern of wind farm layout optimization.In general, the two optimization functions basically match, while for higher wind potential sites, increasing capacity factor did not necessarily result in decreasing levelized cost of energy. The latter may be minimised by reducing the total number of turbines or the overall wind farm capacity, as well as maximising rotor diameters or minimising rated wind speeds; increasing rated power or hub height is only beneficial for mid-potential sites. The mere maximisation of wind farm energy production is a misleading target, as corresponding to mid-to-high values of levelized cost of energy.

Agriculture, if conducted with unsustainable techniques, could cause loss of biodiversity and landscape quality. The aim of this study is to propose a dashboard of indicators to assess the landscape and environmental benefits achievable by a landscape transformation based on a sustainable management of the agriculture activity in an area characterized by the presence of intensive greenhouse farming. The method was applied in the southern coast of Sicily, where there is the largest SCI (Site of Community Importance) and SPA (Special Protection Area) site of the Region. Here, the dune system was seamlessly occupied by greenhouses, so endangering habitats that guarantee the survival of endemic species, such as the Leopoldia gussonei. The main dimensional, visual and agro-environmental indicators for assessing the landscape and environmental pressure were identified and valued both in the actual state and after the hypothesized conversion. The results show that the proposed intervention would allow a meaningful landscape improvement combined with a considerable reduction of the pollution of the area.","2020-03","2020","7980-2020","0264-8377","article",NA,"v. 92","104444",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104444","10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104444","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Since some of these cases have been attributed to airborne transmission or the spread of the virus via inanimate vectors, the aims of this study were to determine MYXV contamination levels and distribution in the environment of vaccinated farms and to ascertain whether the detected virus corresponded to field strains. For that, environmental samples from several areas, tools and employees from four (three infected and one uninfected) rabbitries were taken and analysed by qPCR. MYXV was detected in the environment of all the infected farms, whereas all the samples from the non‐infected farm were negative. Furthermore, all the positive samples contained viral DNA compatible with field strains of the virus. These results lead us to believe that the administration of currently available commercial vaccines does not prevent infected animals from shedding the field virus. Moreover, viral DNA was also found in items that are not in direct contact with the animals, which could play a role in the transmission of the infection throughout the farm and to other farms. Therefore, this study proves that current vaccination schemes on their own are not sufficient to prevent this disease and should be accompanied by adequate biosecurity measures.","2021-05","2021","7979-2021","1865-1674","article","no. 3","v. 68","1424","1431","7","pp. 1424-1431","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13809","10.1111/tbed.13809","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Some of the challenges and opportunities associated with increasing the uptake of IPM in the small-farm sector are discussed. For example, while some IPM tactics are equally applicable to virtually any scale of production, there are others that may be easier (or more cost-effective) to implement on a smaller scale. Conversely, there are approaches that have not been widely applied in small-scale production, but which nevertheless have potential for use in this sector. Examples of such tactics are discussed.

Establishment success is a limitation for post‐rice crops in medium to heavy textured soils in the Eastern Gangetic Plain because sowing coincides with rapid topsoil drying and increases in soil strength. In addition, due to lack of rainfall in the post‐rice season the crop relies on access to stored soil water during vegetative and reproductive growth to achieve adequate yields. Our aim was to determine whether decreased soil disturbance (from full tillage to zero tillage (ZT) to undisturbed soil (Fallow)) and direct seeding (using small‐scale seeders) could 1) enhance chickpea crop establishment by conserving seedbed soil water and 2) alter crop water use of the water stored in the soil profile. The silt loam soil has an estimated volumetric soil water content (θv) of 34% at field capacity. At sowing, θv in the seedbed was between 25% to 29%. This was adequate for successful chickpea crop establishment, but slightly wetter than optimum for tillage. In the wet soil at sowing, there was evidence of smeared furrow walls and poor soil covering of the seed in the seedbed in strip planting (SP; rotating blades in front of tine) and ZT. Uncovered furrows (in ZT; using a tine opener) and the fallow soil lost more surface soil water (9%, 23 days after sowing) than the seedbeds created with greater levels of soil disturbance. In 2008, grain yield of single‐pass shallow tillage (SPST) was greater than SP but in 2009, grain yields of all one‐pass tillage techniques (ZT, SP, SPST) were greater than in the broadcast seeding in fully tilled soils. The improvement in chickpea yields was attributed to greater plant numbers, early plant vigour and root growth. Chickpea roots were found to 60 cm depth in the soil profile, and soil water content was less than the θv of wilting point to this depth at podding. There is evidence that root growth and plant water uptake occur deeper in these soil profiles to achieve the grain yields > 1,000 kg/ha recorded in this study. Mechanised sowing in rows with small‐scale seeders has the capability to overcome establishment and yield limitations for chickpea on medium to heavy soils in the post‐rice season.","2021-04","2021","7979-2021","0931-2250","article","no. 2","v. 207","208","223","15","pp. 208-223","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.12455","10.1111/jac.12455","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

However, sub-Saharan Africa, although highly dependent on agriculture, is vulnerable, most affected, with low-adaptive capacity. Luckily, the region is blessed with inherent adaptation-related strengths that are within reach, to counteract uncertainty in climatic patterns which are expected to continue well into the future. One such strength is a bimodal rainfall pattern that avails the ‘hidden’ multiple season-cropping systems that have the potential to produce four types of crops in a single plot in a single year: short-rains crops, long-rains crops, permanent crops and fruit crops. Despite burgeoning literature on adaptation, the impact of multiple season-cropping systems has not been adequately investigated. This study applies a novel approach to measure its impact on productivity of more than 10,000 smallholder plots using an endogenous switching regression framework. The study finds that plots that adopt multiple season-cropping systems produce higher quantities, earn more crop revenue, and are less likely to be affected by rainfall variability in comparison to plots that engage in single season-cropping systems. As the fight against climate change continues, there is need to move the needle on adaptation and consider strategies that are within reach. The multiple season-cropping systems provide this opportunity and emphasises the benefit of engaging in agriculture throughout the year and producing long-rains, short rains, permanent and fruits crops.","2021-01-15","2021","7979-2021","0301-4797","article",NA,"v. 278","111407",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111407","10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111407","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study. Reports from 980 women who lived or worked on Saskatchewan farms were analyzed to describe their health status, comorbidities, use of medications, and exposures to farm work. Regression models were used to explore determinants of participation in the third shift. Results: Two hundred and sixteen were women [22.0%] engaged in the “third shift”, and these women consistently reported significantly longer mechanized and non-mechanized farm work hours. Compared to women not involved in the third shift, participants in the third shift were more likely to be: 41–50 years of age [ORAdⱼ 2.06 (1.12, 3.77)], and involved in beef cattle production [ORAdⱼ 1.62 (1.05–2.49)], large animal chores [ORAdⱼ 1.66 (1.04–2.66)], use of shovels/pitchforks [ORAdⱼ 1.67 (1.08–2.57)], combine operation [ORAdⱼ 1.72 (1.08–2.74)], and have higher levels of education [e.g., ORAdⱼ 0.46 (0.29–0.72) for high school or less].

The paper concludes that although land ‘matters’ (landholding households are more likely to be food secure and have higher dietary diversity than landless households), this association is strongly conditioned by livelihood and seasonal circumstances. Households with livelihood arrangements articulated to the non-farm economy, whether they were landholders or landless, exhibited superior food and nutritional outcomes compared to those with livelihoods only in farming. Hence, while access to arable land remains an important factor in shaping food security and dietary diversity, of greater importance is the capacity for households to supplement their land assets with livelihood activities in the non-farm economy. This finding reinforces broader arguments that emphasise the importance of the non-farm economy as a vital shaper of wellbeing for rural households in the global South.","2019-04","2019","7981-2019","0743-0167","article",NA,"v. 67","89","100","11","pp. 89-100","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.02.017","10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.02.017","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

However, there has been very limited information about sufficiency of government subsidies and effects of environmental consideration on productive efficiency. The purposes of the study are, therefore, to calculate the opportunity cost of conversion to eco-friendly farming in Samsun and Adana provinces of Turkey, to determine the effects of participating the program on the farm level production efficiency and to reveal link farmers’ satisfaction and opportunity cost of participating to EFALP. The bulk of data were collected from randomly selected 168 farms by using structured questionnaire during the production year of 2015. The difference between the net revenue of participants and non-participant farms was attributed to opportunity cost of conversion to eco-friendly farming system. Data envelopment analysis was used to calculate the efficiency measures such as technical efficiency, allocative efficiency and economic efficiency for similar participants and non-participant farms, which were selected by using cluster analysis. Research result showed that scores of economic efficiency, allocative efficiency and technical efficiency were 0.37, 0.84 and 0.45 in Adana, while that of Samsun were 0.4, 0.77 and 0.60, respectively. The share of subsidies for environmental protection in total subsidies for participant farms in Samsun and Adana was 88.6% and 55.6%, respectively. The opportunity cost of environment protection for average farm was €4454.3 in Adana and €502.5 in Samsun. The quantity of sacrifice for protecting environment in Adana is higher than that of Samsun. Farm level sufficiency of environmental subsidies was 10.6% in Adana, while that of Samsun was more than a hundred. Research results also showed that government environmental subsidies were not allocated efficiently since EFALP ignored the opportunity cost of conversion and its spatial differences. It was clear from the evidence based on the research findings that the quantity of sacrifice for protecting environment was the basic reason for farmers’ satisfaction from EFALP. Rethinking the mechanism of EFALP considering spatial variability of farms’ sacrifice for protecting the environment may reinforce the EFALP.

This study proposes a distributed control strategy to solve the complementary control problem of wind turbines in two offshore wind farms on the basis of the Hamiltonian energy theory. The proposed control strategy not only ensures synchronization for wind turbines in the same farm but also keeps the combined output power of the two wind farms stable. First, through the Hamiltonian realization, the single-machine model of a wind turbine is transformed into a port-controlled Hamiltonian system with dissipation (PCHD). Subsequently, the Hamiltonian energy control law is developed on the basis of the energy-shaping method to adjust the Hamiltonian energy function. The complementary control of the two wind farms is designed to synchronize the wind turbines within an individual wind farm and keep the combined output of the two wind farms stable. Furthermore, the complementary control strategy is modified to address the communication delay between the two wind farms by incorporating time delay into the control problem. Finally, the effectiveness of the distributed complementary control has been verified via simulations.","2018-02-22","2018","7982-2018","2071-1050","article","no. 2","v. 10",NA,NA,NA,NA,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10020553","10.3390/su10020553","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Assessments of BDD lesions were made on five occasions between early lactation (September 2015) and drying-off (May 2016; at approximately 6-week intervals). Along with the clinical assessment, data on farm management practices were collected using questionnaires. In addition, climate data including rainfall and soil/air temperature were obtained from a local weather station. The raw temporal pattern was analysed using a generalised estimating equation method, followed by a mixed effects negative binomial model which modelled the associations between prevalence and the covariates including management practices, rainfall and soil temperature.The highest farm and cow level prevalences were seen on the second visit (27/Oct/2015–11/Dec/2015) and were lowest on the fourth visit (29/Jan/2016–10/Mar/2016). Farms with a higher prevalence at the first visit tended to have a higher prevalence at later visits, even though the affected individuals were often different. There was thus a strong correlation (0.94) between prevalence (proportion of cows affected at each time point) and incidence (proportion of cows with new affections at each time point). Two climate measurements were found to have associations with BDD prevalence. Firstly, increased rainfall in the previous month was associated with decreased cow level prevalence; secondly, there was a quadratic relationship between prevalence and soil temperature, with prevalence increasing as soil temperature increased from 11.8 °C to approximately 18 °C and then decreasing as soil temperature increased from approximately 18 °C to 23.9 °C.

Some questions about the energy output characteristics of mountain wind farms are still unclear. For example, the effect of local wind resource characteristics on the energy output of mountain wind farms. In another scenario, single-unit data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system are used to investigate the performance of wind turbines in some cases. But, single-unit SCADA data may not be very comprehensive. To fill this gap, multiple-units SCADA data of 2 MW wind turbines are used to comparatively investigate the energy characteristics of wind turbines in a mountain wind farm. The main contribution of this paper is to obtain a new and comprehensive understanding of the actual characteristics of the energy output of mountain wind farms, rather than staying in the design stage or general theoretical analysis. Specifically, the following issues, including (1) influence of wind speed on energy output, (2) influence of wind direction on energy output, (3) relationship between rotor speed and energy output, (4) power coefficient, have been discussed in depth. To overcome the influence of inherent deviation in wind speed measurement and the inertia of the wind rotor, a newly improved algorithm for calculating power coefficient is proposed. Creatively, a fast and operable data dividing method is presented, and the power coefficients of different operating regions are given. Through the investigation, the influence of local wind resource characteristics on the energy output is obtained. It is found that in the same mountain wind farm, the energy output curves of different wind turbines are different. For instance, energy outputs for four wind turbines in December 2015 are 434 MW, 614 MW, 205 MW, 255 MW, respectively.","2019-04-01","2019","7981-2019","0306-2619","article",NA,"v. 239","225","238","13","pp. 225-238","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.207","10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.207","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Saltwater intrusion is the landward movement of sea salts, which can alter carbon (C) storage. Transitioning agricultural fields have the potential to become C sinks as SWI advances inland and turns farms to marshes. The objectives of our study were to (1) quantify the size of C pools along a salinity transect; (2) determine how soil C is occluded through levels of physical protection in soil aggregates; (3) examine relationships between indicators of SWI and soil C measures in coastal farm fields. We collected soils (to a depth of ~140 cm) along a transect from the edge of a salt-damaged field (high salinity and frequently inundated) to the center (low salinity and drier). We measured bulk soil C pools and the amount of C stored in large macroaggregates, small macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt+clay size classes. Soil C pools were largest in the edge of field and ditch bank soils compared to the center of the field (P = 0.01). In ditch bank soils, most of the C was stored in large macroaggregates; however, in the center of the field, most C was stored in silt+clays. We suggest that frequent wetting events may lead to increased C storage along the edges of farm fields both as a result of suppressed decomposition rates and increased clay flocculation leading to macroaggregate formation. Further, a vegetation shift from annual, shallow-rooted crops to perennial, deeply rooted marsh grasses along field edges likely contributed to higher soil C levels as well as increased aggregation. An improved understanding of soil C dynamics can help inform management strategies that support farm and environmental wellbeing as our coastlines change.","2021-07-01","2021","7979-2021","0167-8809","article",NA,"v. 314","107416",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107416","10.1016/j.agee.2021.107416","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Instead, they rather prefer to establish new cocoa farms at the expense of forest remnants. Poor management of their overaged farms has resulted in the emergence and outbreaks of new pest species such as termites feeding on the remaining productive trees and negatively affecting overall yield. We investigated how rehabilitation pruning of cocoa trees influences termite outbreaks and yield in three cocoa agroforestry systems (rustic, intermediate and full sun systems). We monitored cocoa and non-cocoa trees at different development stages after rehabilitation pruning and assessed termite diversity and damage. We demonstrated that farm rehabilitation practices are associated with high beta diversity of shade trees and linked with a high diversity of beneficial termite species. Cocoa trees and farm age were positively correlated with the level of infestation by termite species. We also showed that rehabilitation practices improve cocoa tree vigor and yield in cocoa agroforestry systems with the intermediate systems as the most productive after pruning (167 % of yield increase after pruning). Rehabilitation pruning is a suitable practice to rejuvenate aging trees and increase short-term cocoa yield while mitigating the negative effects of insect pests such as termites. It could be recommended as an effective measure for sustainable cocoa production, thereby enhancing ecosystem services provided by local biodiversity and avoiding forest clearance.","2021-05-01","2021","7979-2021","0167-8809","article",NA,"v. 311","107324",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107324","10.1016/j.agee.2021.107324","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

This formalization process will likely establish new centers of production outside the state’s historical cannabis-producing regions, with implications for local communities and the environment. In this paper we analyzed how cultivation regulations and land characteristics correlate with the geographical development of permitted cannabis production centers in California. We used permit data from the first two years of California’s statewide cannabis regulatory program to document geographic variation in cannabis production and farm characteristics (prevalence of onsite residence, non-landowner farming, county zoning classifications, size of cultivation area). We also used multilevel regression models to analyze whether geospatial characteristics likely to be relevant to environmental regulations (size of parcel, average slope of parcel, density of stream network, land cover type) were associated with farm size (cultivation area) or the likelihood of a parcel being enrolled in the state program. We found that a small number of large farms represented the majority of the permitted cultivation area, with the top 10% of largest farms comprising 60% of total cultivated area statewide. The counties with the most growth in permitted cannabis cultivation area also had the highest rates of tenant (non-landowner) farming and lowest proportions of farms with permanent onsite residency. Farms in these counties were almost exclusively sited on parcels zoned for agriculture. On a statewide scale, parcel size was a reliably positive predictor of enrollment, while average slope and stream network density had reliably negative effects. The same relationships held in predicting cultivation area, together suggesting that the development of the newly-formalized cannabis industry in California may be responsive to environmental regulation. Our results suggest two divergent paths of industry development: one in which smaller farms, which often pre-date legalization, navigate regulations in more remote and rugged regions and a second comprising large farms, which are often newer and operate in areas more favorable to meeting environmental requirements of state and county policies.","2021-06","2021","7979-2021","0264-8377","article",NA,"v. 105","105369",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105369","10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105369","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Do climate change attitudes influence behaviour or is it possible that behaviour can change attitudes? This study uses a unique repeated survey dataset of 275 farmers (irrigators) in the southern Murray-Darling Basin from 2010–11 to 2015–16, to explore the dynamic relationship between climate change risk perceptions and farm adaptation behaviour. Farmers who had an increased risk exposure (expressed through higher debt, larger irrigated areas, greater share of permanent crops, and located in areas with higher temperatures and less rainfall) were more likely to agree climate change posed a risk. Whilst farmers became more accepting towards climate change over the time-period, a significant percentage of these attitudes were unstable. One reason suggested for this instability is the presence of a feedback loop between risk perceptions and behaviour. Namely, new evidence was found that farmers who agreed climate change was a risk in 2010–11, were more likely to undertake farm production decisions to reduce that risk (e.g. changing crop mix, reducing irrigated area and consequently selling water entitlements) – which had the impact of negatively feeding back and reducing their stated climate change risk perceptions in 2015–16. Conversely, farmers who were originally deniers were more likely to undertake somewhat riskier farm production decisions (e.g. increasing water utilisation rates and irrigation areas) – which consequently had the impact of positively increasing their climate change risk perceptions in 2015–16.","2021-05","2021","7979-2021","0959-3780","article",NA,"v. 68","102274",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102274","10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102274","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

TBP is crucial to the testis function because of the high metabolic rate and very low concentration of oxygen in the seminiferous tubules, which constitute about 70%–80% of the testicular mass. Color Doppler ultrasonography is one of the recent non-invasive technologies, which plays a vital role in the assessment of blood flow to the testis in various animal species. In the past 20 years, a significant number of studies have highlighted the importance of assessments of TBP using color Doppler ultrasonography to illustrate its potential uses for breeding soundness examination, diagnosis, and monitoring of infertility problems in farm animals. This review was aimed at providing, for the first time, updated knowledge on the potential clinical uses of color Doppler ultrasonography for the assessment of TBP in domestic animals. Additionally, a few essential details on the relationship between TBP and male fertility are discussed in this review.

Despite this, empirical research focusing on farm-level application of smart farming reveals a more complex and nuanced picture characterised by considerable uncertainty over its implementation and use. In this paper we seek to extend farm-level research by investigating two questions: how do perceived uncertainties destabilise meso-scale actors' routines and practices that are critical for ‘supporting farmer learning about the nature of digital data and its interpretation’ (Eastwood et al., 2019: 8); and, in what ways do meso-scale actors seek to re-establish a sense of stability and, in doing so, manage the uncertainty associated with smart farming implementation, and technological change more broadly? To address these questions we investigate the findings from a qualitative study of 20 meso-scale actors involved in the planning and implementation of smart farming technology in the Australian rice industry through an ontological security lens. We refer to meso-scale actors as farm advisors and agronomists whom we argue play a critical role in the uptake of smart farming technology. In applying this lens we argue that the perceived uncertainties related to smart farming de-stabilise or de-securitise actors' day-to-day roles and routines, impacting on who they are and what they do. We then demonstrate that actors draw upon two specific cultural scripts as a way to re-securitise their uncertainty. The first script seeks to securitise resource uncertainty by drawing upon known discourses surrounding farmer adoption of technology, while the second reproduces the importance of technologies that are easy to adopt while downplaying the importance of smart farming technology. While at face value these scripts can appear to create barriers to smart farming adoption, we argue that they can be a catalyst for developing solutions to uncertainty in terms of making smart farming more workable at the farm-level.","2021-01","2021","7979-2021","0743-0167","article",NA,"v. 81","315","323","8","pp. 315-323","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.10.051","10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.10.051","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

These surveys have looked mainly at the farmers, the majority of whom have reported they rely on the advice of their local veterinarian or suppliers for treatment and management. However, there is little research into the psychology of veterinarians and people performing animal health testing on this topic. In the current study, a short survey of people performing faecal egg counts on animals was conducted.

As influenced by the geographical features of the wind region, the power output from each wind farm is closely correlated to the local-patterns of its covered weather. However, modeling the highly time-varying nature of the local-patterns’ spatial distribution remains the key challenge to regional wind power forecast. For this purpose, a sub-region is proposed to represent the spatial scale of wind farms covered by the same local-pattern. All wind farms in the wind region are divided into multiple sub-regions. This classification is defined as the partition which represents a typical state of the wind region. To deal with the time-varying nature, partitions are considered on the adaptive process. In this paper, a regional wind power forecasting method based on adaptive partition and long-short-term matching is proposed. First, a refined partition set of wind region is determined by the Regional Hierarchical Clustering algorithm. Second, to identify the current states of the wind region, the partition with minimum forecasting error is chosen as Optimal Partition. Third, the long-short-term matching strategy is proposed to find the adaptive partition among the refined partition set with the indication of recent and historical Optimal Partitions. Eventually, for each time horizon, the forecasted power of each sub-regions in the adaptive partition is aggregated to achieve the final regional wind power forecasting results. The superior performance and robustness of the proposed methods are validated with actual wind generation data from a wind region which contains nine wind farms in China.

Syndromic surveillance of farmers’ disease observations can improve animal health data capture from extensive livestock farming systems, especially where data are not otherwise being systematically collected or when data on confirmed aetiological diagnoses are unavailable at the disease level. As it is rarely feasible to recruit a truly random sample of farmers to provide observational reports, directing farmer sampling to align with the surveillance objectives is a reasonable and practical approach. As long as potential bias is recognised and managed, farmers who will report reliably can be desirable participants in a surveillance system. Thus, one early objective of a surveillance program should be to identify characteristics associated with reporting behaviour. Knowledge of the demographic and managerial characteristics of good reporters can inform efforts to recruit additional farms into the system or aid understanding of potential bias of system reports.We describe the operation of a farmer syndromic surveillance system in Victoria, Australia, over its first two years from 2014 to 2016. Survival analysis and classification and regression tree analysis were used to identify farm level factors associated with ‘reliable’ participation (low non-response rates in longitudinal reporting). Response rate and timeliness were not associated with whether farmers had disease to report, or with different months of the year. Farmers keeping only sheep were the most reliable and timely respondents. Farmers < 43 years of age had lower response rates than older farmers. Farmers with veterinary qualifications and those working full-time on-farm provided less timely reports than other educational backgrounds and farmers who worked part-time on-farm.

Offshore wind energy sector has been clearly the fastest in its development among other options, and development of new wind farms requires large ocean space. Therefore, there is a need of efficient spatial planning process, including the site selection constrained by technical (wind resource, coastal distance, seafloor) and environmental (impacts) factors and competence of uses. We present a novel approach, using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN), for an integrated spatially explicit site feasibility identification for offshore wind farms. Our objectives are to: (i) develop a spatially explicit model that integrates the technical, economic, environmental and social dimensions; (ii) operationalize the BBN model; (iii) implement the model at local (Basque Country) and regional (North East Atlantic and Western Mediterranean), and (iv) develop and analyse future scenarios for wind farm installation in a local case study. Results demonstrated a total of 1% (23 km2) of moderate feasibility areas in local scaled analysis, compared to 4% of (21,600 km2) very high, and 5% (30,000 km2) of high feasibility in larger scale analysis. The main challenges were data availability and discretization when trying to expand the model from local to regional level. The use of BBN models to determine the feasibility of offshore wind farm areas has been demonstrated adequate and possible, both at local and regional scales, allowing managers to take management decisions regarding marine spatial planning when including different activities, environmental problems and technological constraints.","2019-06-01","2019","7981-2019","0048-9697","article",NA,"v. 667","306","317","11","pp. 306-317","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.268","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.268","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Two optimization schemes, the weighted optimization and confidence interval optimization are compared in term of their performances on trading off energy-variance. For the weighted optimization, the objective function weight value α varies from 0 to 1 (implying the optimization objective shifts its weight from the power variance to the power output), while for the confidence interval (CI) optimization, either the lower or the upper limit of power output CI is maximized/minimized. It is found that the CI maximization achieves a trade-off of mean power output and power variance similar to the weighted optimization with α≥0.6, and the same individual power output range (192 kW–207 kW) is obtained with staggered placements of wind turbines. The CI minimization obtains a trade-off of average power output and power variance close to the weighted optimization with α≤0.4, and the optimal wind turbine locations are aligned.

Such long-scale trajectory of adaptation has resulted in a wide range of traditional rural and peri-urban landscapes hosting a rich biodiversity and bearing multiple social and cultural values. Throughout recent history, and especially over the past two decades, Mediterranean farm and land use systems have been undergoing multiple transition processes, resulting in many current landscapes gradually becoming more homogeneous and intensified, whilst others are being abandoned. It has now become self-evident that both trajectories of change are evolving at unequal rates and scales across the region.

This will exacerbate the issue whereby its intermittent energy production does not generally coincide with energy demand. This can be addressed by integrating cost-effective energy storage with wind farms. The present study develops a concept that leverages the capacity of underground reservoirs of abandoned oil or gas wells to avoid the costs of expensive storage vessels and employs isothermal processes for the compressed air energy storage to improve round-trip efficiency. By levelizing the production using compressed air energy storage, the electrical generator size (and associated) cost may be reduced while maintaining the same average power production. These generator cost savings are projected to offset the cost of the storage system, so increased dispachtability is obtained with little to no added cost. This allows the predicted Cost of Valued Energy to be lowered by more than 10% for a typical wind farm, used as a case study. In addition, the simulated dispatchability ratio can reach 86.7%, which is far better than the 55.7% of a wind farm without storage. Importantly, the siting of wind farms near abandoned wells and mines also has the potential for significant new infrastructure investment and jobs in areas that might be economically-depressed. However, experimental verification with a pilot facility combined with ramifications of operational costs and geological factors are needed to demonstrate and quantify the benefits of this concept.","2021-06-15","2021","7979-2021","0306-2619","article",NA,"v. 292","116867",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116867","10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116867","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Although there are several serotypes associated with disease, untypable isolates have also been observed. The objective of this study was to investigate the relatedness of untypable S. suis isolates detected in clinical cases and healthy pigs in Ontario, Canada, and their relation to typing serotypes. One hundred fifty-six isolates obtained from 33 cases and 26 farm-and-pen-matched control pigs were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq sequencing. Protein sequences of the capsular polysaccharide genes (cps) were identified and analyzed using a maximum likelihood tree. Among the 27 untypable isolates, 3 were from systemic sites of cases and 13 and 11 were from upper respiratory sites of cases and controls, respectively. One hundred fifty-six isolates were grouped into 17 distinct groups based on the cps gene tree. Isolates from these 17 distinct individual cps groups were distributed among a minimum of one farm and maximum of eight farms. Untypable isolates were detected in 12 of those groups and each cps group had untypable isolates present amongst multiple farms.

In this article we analyze revenue losses and cost increases due to D. suzukii as perceived of Swiss cherry, plum and grape growers. Moreover, we investigate associations between farm and grower characteristics and revenue losses and perceived costs increases. We surveyed Swiss growers of cherries, plums and grapes repeatedly in the period 2016–2018 (N = 1572). RESULTS: We find that 76% of cherry, plum and grape growers faced additional costs due to D. suzukii. In contrast, yield losses due to D. suzukii infestation were small on average, but nevertheless high for some growers. We find substantial heterogeneity in perceived costs and revenue losses across crops, years and farms. Larger farms are found to face lower perceived additional costs, suggesting scale effects in prevention and control of D. suzukii. Growers with a higher inter‐varietal diversity perceived additional costs to be higher. Furthermore, organic farming was negatively associated with expected additional costs. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the economic impact of invasive species such as D. suzukii goes far beyond reductions in yield quantity and quality, but rather stems from higher costs due to the need to establish preventive and control measures. Heterogeneity in costs and revenue losses suggests that policy measures to support growers need to be tailored to crops and farm types. Policies supporting improvements of measures against D. suzukii and other newly occurring alien pests and reduce additional costs such as more efficient preventive and control measures merit further encouragement.","2021-02","2021","7979-2021","1526-498X","article","no. 2","v. 77","978","1000","22","pp. 978-1000","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6110","10.1002/ps.6110","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

A variety of these habitats and species are particularly sensitive to deposition of nitrogen caused by ammonia emissions. Livestock farming is the primary source of this pollution. The purpose of this paper is to compare the costs of reaching the ammonia emission targets for different livestock farms near Natura 2000 sites in the Netherlands, Germany (Schleswig-Holstein), and Denmark. These countries have some of the highest NH3 deposition rates in Europe, and Germany in particular will have to implement new measures to reach the NEC requirements for 2030. This will also benefit nature sites in Denmark as a large share of the ammonia emissions is dispersed over long distances. The general regulation includes implementation of BAT technologies and emission ceilings. The analysis looks at regulatory aspects, the emission requirements and the cost of implementing the technologies to reduce emissions further. The selected case farms are a finisher farm and a dairy farm, and the distance to a Natura 2000 site is 400 and 2000 m. In all three countries, relatively few livestock farms are situated near or inside Natura 2000 areas. The regulatory approach is very different in the three countries and key issues are: additional deposition from projects, neighbouring livestock farms (cumulation), the inclusion of background deposition and the use of the critical loads concept. The Dutch PAS system is interesting as projected reductions in emissions are distributed as additional “room for development” today. The costs for the case farm with finishers in Schleswig-Holstein are the highest as the Filter Decree requires the use of air scrubbers. The findings suggest that farms 400 m from a Natura 2000 site in the Netherlands face lower and less costly constraints than in the other countries, whereas the opposite is the case for farms 2000 m from Natura 2000 sites. The requirements near Natura 2000, where strict requirements apply, are so high that farms will expand at a different site instead.","2019-09-15","2019","7981-2019","0301-4797","article",NA,"v. 246","897","908","11","pp. 897-908","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.05.106","10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.05.106","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

In addition, the inspections have a limited effect on improving farm compliance. We looked at the perceptions of both farmers and their inspectors about animal welfare and the inspections in a case study of dairy production in France. The identification of gaps and commonalities between both parties should help us to propose improvements in the inspection method by which inspections could more likely encourage compliance with animal welfare legislation. To achieve this aim, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 dairy farmers and their 19 inspectors. Both farmers and inspectors described animal welfare in terms of the state of the animal and of the living conditions and care provided to them. The majority of farmers found that the official checklist used by the inspectors is inappropriate to assess the welfare of their animals; inspectors themselves reported that they often use their own criteria and indicators (often based on the observation of animals) in addition to the official checklist. Both groups disagreed with some requirements of the legislation. These findings suggest that the content and background of the legislation to protect animals should be made clearer to both farmers and inspectors and that these two groups of actors should be involved in the definition of key points to be checked on farms, with special attention to animal-based indicators. All this could improve farmers' engagement with the results of the inspections and, hopefully, could lead to better compliance with legislation and improvements in animal welfare on farms.","2021-01","2021","7979-2021","1751-7311","article","no. 1","v. 15","100038",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2020.100038","10.1016/j.animal.2020.100038","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

In the 1990s, following decollectivisation, many Romanian farmers who received back small individual plots, pooled their land and resources with family and neighbours to cultivate in groups, or joined large agricultural associations for marketing. Subsequent decades have seen an aging population, reverse urban to rural migration, the country’s entry into the EU in 2007, and new financial support for farmers, both from the EU and the Romanian government. Given these changes, how many of the old group farms are still active? Are new ones emerging? And is there still a case for farmer cooperation in agriculture, as is being encouraged by the Romanian government? This is the first paper that addresses these questions, by seeking to trace the 1990s group farms and associations in Iasi and Ialomita counties and interviewing the members. Using a longitudinal approach and qualitative insights, it analyses what factors enabled some groups to continue and led others to dissolve. New groups, formed after 2005, were also located and analysed. An aging membership, outmigration of youth, and conflicts among members primarily underlay group farms becoming inactive, while many large associations went bankrupt. The still-active group farms were those able to mechanise and enlarge farm size with leased in land, drawing on new funding options and younger people to take over. Also, both the old active groups and newly formed ones typically specialise in livestock and dairy which require more labour and coordination. It is in such activities that we might also expect a future for cooperation among Romanian farmers.","2021-01","2021","7979-2021","0743-0167","article",NA,"v. 81","148","158","10","pp. 148-158","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.10.006","10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.10.006","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"

Increasing farmers' willingness to recover pig production contributes to enhance pig supply, stabilize the pig and pork market, and to improve pig farmers' income. This research studies the determinants of pig farmers' willingness to recover production under COVID-19 pandemic shock by applying survey data of 201 farmers in Huai'an City and Lin'an City and a logit regression model. The estimation results show that a farmer's risk perception, the duration time of a farmer's feed supply under COVID-19 pandemic shock, whether or not being a cooperative member, and a farmer's knowledge on government's policy designed to encourage pig production, a farmer's education level and production experience are the key determinants to a farmer's willingness to recover pig production. Thus, it's important for policymakers to solve the problems for farmers to get access to feed during the pandemic, to encourage the development of cooperatives, as well as to issue and advocate policies to encourage pig production. The study contributes to the scant literature by providing fresh empirical evidences on determinants of farmers' willingness to recover pig production.

From a farm economic perspective, an increase in field size increases efficiency mainly due to cost savings. However, recent evidence suggests that increases in field size might lead to the loss of ecosystem services provided by farmland biodiversity, but this trade-off is rarely considered. Here, we aim to quantify the economic and ecological effects of these changes by developing a bio-economic simulation-based land-use modelling framework based on spatially explicit data from an agricultural region in Germany. The results show a substantial decrease in flower visitation in oilseed rape when field sizes increase and permanent green edges are lost. This also leads to a decrease in pollination from wild bees and affects yields and farm economics. However, this loss in agricultural gross margin is overcompensated by economic gains of field enlargement. We conclude that further, more comprehensive evaluations are required and suggest that maintaining fine-grained agricultural landscapes with permanent field margins in the long term may require incentives to farmers, as well as innovations that allow to farm small fields at lower costs.","2020-03","2020","7980-2020","0921-8009","article",NA,"v. 169","106535",NA,NA,NA,"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106535","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106535","Citation in PubAg","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NULL"
